## Course Policies and Resources
### Our Inclusive Learning Environment
Diverse backgrounds, embodiments, and experiences are essential to the critical thinking endeavor at the heart of university education. Therefore, I expect you to follow the [UW Student Conduct Code](https://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/WAC/478-120-024.html) in your interactions with your colleagues and me in this course by respecting the many social and cultural differences among us, which may include, but are not limited to: age, cultural background, disability, ethnicity, family status, gender identity and presentation, citizenship and immigration status, national origin, race, religious and political beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and veteran status. Please talk with me right away if you experience or observe disrespect in this class, and I will work to address it with you.

### Communicating with the Instructional Team
#### Questions about the Course? Use Canvas Discussion Board.
It’s not feasible for members of the instructional team respond to individual emails about the course content or schedule. If you have a question along these lines, please post it to the Canvas Discussion Board rather than contacting one member of the instructional team. That way you will be accessing the collective knowledge of the entire class, who are all thinking about the same things as you. You are likely to receive an answer much more quickly than if you only message me or your TA. However, The TAs and I will be actively monitoring the discussion board and will answer questions as we find them. Many of your colleagues will probably have the same question as you, so posting your question on Canvas helps everyone in the class.
#### How to get us to respond to your message
Communicate with members of the instructional team using a **Canvas Inbox message**, not email. This ensures that our communication is FERPA compliant. We will do our best to respond within two business days to a message that you send, but to maximize your chances of hearing back, please adhere to the following. 
- Message about private matters, such as grades, or requests for private appointments. Questions about course content or the course schedule should be posted to the Canvas Discussion Board.
- Use a [Canvas Inbox message](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Inbox-as-a-student/ta-p/532). 
- Do not send separate, duplicate messages to multiple members of the instructional team. 
- If you haven't heard back within two business days, feel free to send another message.

Present yourself in a professional manner:
- Write in complete sentences. Employ proper punctuation and grammar.
- Communication must be consistent with our Inclusive Learning Environment and the Student Conduct Code, including policies related to harassing and bullying ([WAC 478-121-133](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=478-121-133)) as well as discrimination and harassment based on protected class statuses (see [Student Policy 210](https://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH210.html) and the [Student Conduct Code](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/for-students/student-code-of-conduct/)).

### Grades
Scores for all assignments will be posted to Canvas. When calculating the final score (in percent), assignments are weighted as indicated in the table on [Grades](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1716626/grades).

When calculating the final grade, I determine:
- The final score that will yield a 4.0. This score is typically 90%-95%.
- The final score that will yield a 2.0. This score is typically 65%-75%.
- A linear function that includes those two points. 

I spend a lot of time assigning the scores used for this function. Primarily, I look at submitted work that led to scores in those ranges and compare the extent of learning demonstrated in that assessment relative to that of assessments in prior years. 

### Getting Help
- **Ask questions** during class, labs, and/or office hours. 
- **Office Hours**, as indicated in the [calendar](../../calendar) and by appointment.
> Just as professional athletes rely on coaches to maximize their performance, students who aim to reach the highest levels of success are more likely to accomplish their goals with coaching. As course instructors, an important part of our role is to serve as your “academic coaches.” While we are happy to engage in discussion during class activity time and answer brief questions after class, our Office Hours are the best opportunity for asking questions and getting advice. All students are welcome to attend Office Hours and topics of discussion may include (but are not limited to) specific material from the course, how to improve study habits, how to succeed in college, and future career plans. We are here to be a resource for your success! (adapted from Prof. Jen Heemstra, Emory University) 
- The [**discussion board**](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1778379/discussion_topics) is a good place to post questions. While you are there, take a look at your classmates’ posts and see whether you can help them. Learning happens when people share experiences, knowledge, and ideas.
- **Form your own study group**. Try using the course discussion board to find interested classmates. You have your own Zoom account, so you can connect virtually to discuss the course!
- The **Center for Learning and Undergraduate Enrichment (CLUE)** offers free drop-in tutoring for Chemistry during 10:00 am - 3:00 pm (Pacific) on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday via Zoom. See the [CLUE website](https://academicsupport.uw.edu/clue/) for more information. 
- The [Instructional Center](https://depts.washington.edu/ic/content/index.php?style=graphics) offers free drop-in tutoring, review sessions, study skills seminars, and more for students who are members of [TRIO](https://depts.washington.edu/omadcs/trio-sss/) or [EOP](https://depts.washington.edu/omadcs/eop/) (students who are not members of TRIO or EOP may apply to access IC services on a space-available basis). 

### Academic Integrity
The [Student Conduct Code](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH209.html#7) prohibits several forms of academic misconduct (see section 7: Prohibited Conduct), including:
- Cheating
- Falsification
- Plagiarism
- Unauthorized collaboration
- Engaging in behavior specifically prohibited by an instructor
- Recording and/or dissemination of instructional content without express permission of the instructor

Your submissions for online assignments and exams should be your own, individual work unless you are explicitly told otherwise. You will sign and submit an honor code statement for this course, and for all quizzes/exams in this course.

For exams and/or quizzes, you may not seek out or accept any input from other individuals, and you may not communicate with other members of the class or provide assistance to other students during or after the assignments unless an instructor explicitly allows for that collaboration.

It is presumed that the data you submit in the lab reports was acquired by you or provided to you by the instructor. All data analysis and written/typed calculations and responses that you submit should be yours alone. We often find examples of plagiarism in which lab reports are copied from someone else, or from an earlier quarter.​ In short, if you have not done something yourself, do not attempt to pass it off as original work. If you have questions about what might cross the line, please do not hesitate to ask your lab or class instructor prior to submitting your work. 

You are prohibited from sharing content from any assignments, quizzes, exams, labs, etc. with any non-UW course content repositories. Examples include BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: Chegg, CourseHero, Reddit, SnapChat, etc. NOTE: This prohibition applies whether or not the assignment deadline has passed. For example, you may not post exam questions to Chegg, etc. even after the key to the exam has been posted. If you have questions about how to solve a question from the exam, reach out to a member of the teaching team.

Failure to adhere to this code of ethics will result in referral for possible disciplinary action as described in the Student Conduct Code.

### Religious Accommodations
Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW’s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at [Religious Accommodations Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request form](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/).

## Lab-Specific Policies and Resources
- You will not be assigned a desk for this laboratory. Lab work is done at various locations, as listed above. Computers are available for data analysis and report writing.
- Most of you will be working in pairs (labeled A, B, C and D in the Laboratory Schedule). It is desirable that each partner obtains their own data. In rare cases, this will be impossible. However, each person must prepare separate, independent submissions. Copying or paraphrasing of a partner's work will result in a mark of zero on that lab for both partners.

### Expectations In Lab
- Arrive in lab on time and prepared for the scheduled activity. Read the manual carefully before performing the experiments. The TA will be happy to answer any questions at the beginning of the lab period. Note that there are references at the beginning of some of the experiments. These are available either in the library or on-line. You may find it helpful to consult them before embarking on the experiments if you have questions about the experimental methods or principles of operation. 
- If you arrive more than 10 minutes late, the TA may exclude you from lab that day.
- Students must conduct laboratory work in a safe and courteous manner. This includes following department [safety protocols](https://chem.washington.edu/lab-safety-protocols). More generally, this includes not interfering with activities of others, including the responsibilities of TAs to maintain a safe lab environment and the ability of other students to conduct their laboratory work.
- Before leaving the laboratory, you must show your laboratory notes and data to the TA or the instructor for preliminary evaluation. Make sure that you have properly restored the instrument to its stand-by condition. This is required for full credit for the in-lab and post-lab portion of the activity.
### Lab Attire
At all times in laboratory spaces, students must wear appropriate [lab attire](https://chem.washington.edu/student-lab-attire), including PPE.
### Submissions
- The pre-lab and post-lab submissions for each activity must be typed and submitted electronically on Canvas.
### Due Dates and Late Submissions
- The pre-lab for each activity is due at the beginning of the lab period when you are scheduled for that activity. Students who have submitted a pre-lab may view a key for the pre-lab before they begin their lab work.
- The post-lab for each activity is due at the beginning of the lab period following when you were scheduled for that activity.
- Late submissions will be penalized by 10% of the maximum points per day.
- No submissions will be accepted after 5 pm on the last day of instruction (March 14, 2025).
### Additional Help
- Like other portions of the course, you may ask questions during office hours and post questions on the discussion board.
- After the first hour of a scheduled lab section, students from other sections may drop in to talk with the TA for that section. Note: The TA must prioritize students enrolled in the current section, but will help a student from another section as time permits. At all times in laboratory spaces, students must wear appropriate [lab attire](https://chem.washington.edu/student-lab-attire), including PPE.
### Excused Absences and Reschedules
- Document absences using the [UW Chemistry Absence Form](https://chem.washington.edu/student-absences).
- To reschedule a lab activity, please coordinate with the Stockroom manager.
- If you are unable to reschedule a lab activity, work with your teaching assistant to receive sample data that you can use to complete the post-lab.
