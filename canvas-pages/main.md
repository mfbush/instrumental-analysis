## Welcome!
Welcome to Instrumental Analysis (CHEM 426/526)! As a [practicing mass spectrometrist](https://biophysicalms.org/people/mattbush/), I look forward to teaching this course and sharing some of what I have learned about developing and applying chemical measurements.

## Course Materials

### Course Calendar
- The course uses the [syllabus](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1861822/assignments/syllabus) and [calendar](../../calendar) that are built into Canvas.

### Classroom-Associated Learning
These pages include everything that you'll learn in and out of the classroom, excluding lab.

## Course-Level Learning Objectives
Instrumental Analysis introduces students to modern instrumental methods of chemical analysis. Semiweekly lectures will cover topics including the principles of operation of the major classes of chemical instrumentation, figures of merit for evaluating chemical measurements, and using data from chemical measurements to inform decisions. Weekly laboratory projects will train students to operate modern instruments:
- Describe the principles of operation of the major classes of modern chemical instrumentation.
- Use modern chemical instrumentation in practical settings to analyze real samples.
- Evaluate the performance of chemical measurement in terms of figures of merit including limit of detection, linear dynamic range, and resolution.
- Compare and contrast different measurement approaches for specific analytical situations. Select a measurement approach to guide a decision.

The learning objectives and activities for this course were developed with the following core competencies in mind:
- Apply the process of science; use scientific principles and reasoning to form testable hypotheses.
- Analyze data using appropriate statistical methods. 
- Evaluate and report the accuracy and precision of measurements.
- Draw conclusions from data.
- Manage data effectively and keep accurate records.
- Communicate and collaborate with a diverse group of peers to solve scientific problems.
