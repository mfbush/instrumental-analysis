## Analytes, Signals, and Noise
### Learning Objectives
*At the conclusion of in-class and outside learning, participants will be able to:*
- Define “analyte”.
- Describe the differences between qualitative and quantitative analysis.

- Calculate the concentration of an analyte in a sample, based on analysis of a sample and multiple external standards.
- Describe the differences between deterministic and indeterministic errors.
- Based on results for replicate measurements using the same method, calculate the noise and the limit of detection of the method.

## Exam #1
### What to Expect
- Exams are designed to measure how well each student has mastered the specific learning objectives described above. Questions on the exam will assess one or more of those learning objectives.
- Each exam will consist of three or four multipart problems that will require quantitative reasoning and critical thinking. A typical problem consist of a paragraph describing a protocol or scenario, some experimental data (tables, graphs, etc.), and a series of questions. 
- Each exam will take place during a scheduled class time. Students can bring a note card (described below), but otherwise, the exam will be closed notes / closed book.
### What to Bring to the Exam
- Calculator. Anything readily recognizable as a scientific or graphing calculator. No QWERTY keyboard. Not able to connect to the internet.
- 3"x5" note card, with notes on both sides. Must turn in note card with exam.
