# CHEM 426/526 - Instrumental Analysis at the University of Washington
Welcome to Instrumental Analysis (CHEM 426/526)! As a practicing mass spectrometrist [instructor biography](https://biophysicalms.org/people/mattbush/), I look forward to teaching this course and sharing some of what I have learned about developing and applying chemical measurements.
## Course Level Learning Objectives
This course introduces students to modern instrumental methods of chemical analysis. Semiweekly lectures will cover topics including the principles of operation of the major classes of chemical instrumentation, figures of merit for evaluating chemical measurements, and using data from chemical measurements to inform decisions in research and society. Weekly laboratory projects will train students to operate modern instruments that make use of spectroscopy, separations, and mass spectrometry, as well as the associated sample preparation and data analysis. At the completion of this course, participants will be able to:
1. Describe the principles of operation of the major classes of modern chemical instrumentation.
2. Use modern chemical instrumentation in practical settings to analyze real samples.
3. Evaluate the performance of chemical measurement in terms of figures of merit including limit of detection, linear dynamic range, and resolution.
4. Compare and contrast different measurement approaches for specific analytical situations. Select a measurement approach to guide a decision in the context of biomedical research and medical diagnostics.
