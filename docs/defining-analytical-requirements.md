# Defining Analytical Requirements
## Learning Objectives
*At the conclusion of this activity, participants will be able to…*
1. Define the analytical requirements of a chemical measurements, including:
   - What is the analyte?
   - What is the nature of the sample?
   - What information is needed (qualitative, quantitative)?
   - What level(s) of analyte(s) is (are) expected?
   - For quantitative analysis, what is the detection threshold, and what is the required precision and accuracy?
## Scope of Course
Recently, *J. Chem. Edu.* published an article titled "Survey of Instrumentation Use in Industry: What Does Industry Want New Chemists to Know?" ([link](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.3c00990)). The article reports results from a survey of employers spanning the chemical industry (regulatory/analytical, pharmaceutical, chemical/materials, and semiconductor) and soughts to answer the following reserach questions (copied verbatim):
1.	What types of instrumentation are most commonly used by industry chemists?
2.	What specific instruments do industry employers expect newly hired chemists with a bachelor’s degree to have experience with?
3.	How does instrumentation use and expected experience in chemical industry vary across industrial contexts?
4.	How do industry employers rank the importance of skills and undergraduate coursework for newly hired chemists?

Figure 1. Percentage of chemical industry companies (N = 80) indicating instrument use (shown in blue) and expected experience (shown in red) when hiring new chemists. The top five instruments for both use and expected experience included Mass Spectrometry (MS), Liquid Chromatography (LC), UV–Vis Spectroscopy, Gas Chromatography (GC), and Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy.
