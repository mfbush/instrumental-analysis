The specific matrix molecule is selected for a specific application. For example, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid is commonly used for the analysis of peptides, lipids, and nucleic acids, whereas sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) is commonly used for the analysis of large peptides, whole proteins, and lipids.  \n",

The electrospray capillary is held at a high potential (typically 1-5 kV) relative to the atmospheric-pressure inlet of the mass spectrometer.

The coulombic repulsion of those excess charges overcomes the surface tension of the liquid, which results in the formation of a Taylor cone and the expulsion of highly charged droplets. Those droplets undergo desolvation and fission, which eventually results in the formation of gas-phase ions. [Figure Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrospray_ionization). \n",

The formation of multiply charged ions is common for analytes with higher masses, e.g., synthetic polymers and proteins, whereas the formation of singly charged ions is common for small mocules."
