    "Measuring a voltage or a current will draw current from the signal source, creating a voltage divider effect between the transducer's internal resistance and the instrument's input impedance. This current draw causes the measured voltage to drop below the actual transduced signal. This measurement error called \"loading\" the signal source.\n",

Therefore, these devices draw negligible current from the transducer, preserving the original signal voltage while simultaneously providing gain to amplify the weak signal to a measurable level. Essentially, op-amps act as high-impedance buffers that faithfully capture small signals without distorting them, then amplify these signals for accurate quantitation. \n",

In real operational amplifiers, the input impedance is typically very high, on the order of $10^6$ to $10^{12}$ ohms, which enables the operational amplifier to measure signals from high-impedance sources without distorting the measurement.\n",
