    "## Principles of Fourier Transform Optical Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, all of the instruments for analytical spectroscopy that we have discussed are operated in the *frequency domain*. Data is acquired as a function of frequency using filters or monochromators (single-channel measurements) or dispersion light in space and multiple detectors (multichannel measurements using diode-array detectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges for Measuring IR Spectra Using these Approaches\n",
    "- Large noise due to the low intensity of infrared light source.\n",
    "- Poor sensitivity and slow response time of IR light detectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Perform Measurements in the Time Domain\n",
    "An alternative approach is to acquire data in the *time domain*. FT-IR allows simultaneous measurement of all wavelengths through the use of an interferometer, typically a Michelson interferometer, rather than measuring each wavelength sequentially. \n",
    "- The interferometer produces an interferogram containing information about all frequencies\n",
    "- The interferogram is then mathematically converted to a spectrum using a Fourier transform\n",
    "- Relative to dispersive techniques, this process results in:\n",
    "    -  significantly faster data collection, because all frequencies are analyzed simultaneously\n",
    "    -  significantly more light is transmitted to the detector, because less light is filtered away\n",
    "    -  improved signal-to-noise ratio, because it is easier to average many replicate measurements and $(\\frac{S}{N})_n \\approx \\sqrt{n}\\cdot   (\\frac{S}{N})_i$ for $n$ independent measurements.\n",

    "### Michelson interferometer\n",
    "Signals like that in Figure 2 are not directly measurable because the frequencies of IR spectroscopy ($10^{12}-10^{15} Hz$) are too high for existing transducers. To obtain those time-domain signals, the high-frequency signal is converted (i.e., modulated) to a measurable frequency, without distorting the information carried in the original signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Michelson interferometer splits a beam of light into two paths using a beamsplitter: one beam reflects off a fixed mirror while the other reflects off a moving mirror. When the beams recombine, their phase difference creates an interference pattern that varies with the moving mirror's position. In FT-IR, this interference pattern produces the interferogram that is later Fourier transformed into a spectrum.\n",

    "A Fourier transform converts the interferogram (a plot of light intensity versus mirror position) into a spectrum (intensity versus frequency) by decomposing the time-domain signal into its constituent frequency components. This mathematical operation essentially decodes how much each frequency contributes to the original interferogram pattern.\n",

In one arm of the interferometer, the IR source radiation travels through the beam splitter to the fixed mirror, back to the beamsplitter, and through the sample to the IR transducer. In the other arm, the IR source radiation travels to the beamsplitter, is reflected to the movable mirror, and travels back through the beamsplitter to the sample and to the transducer. When the beams mean again at the beamsplitter, they can interfere with each other. A plot of the signal versus mirror displacement is the interferogram, which contains information about all of the frequences present. The spectrum, intensity versus frequency, is the Fourier transform of the interferrogram.  \n",
