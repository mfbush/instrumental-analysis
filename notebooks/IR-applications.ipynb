    "### In Practice - Spectral Libraries\n",

    "Most spectra are assigned through comparisons with spectra libraries, which contain spectra obtained for pure standards. Some examples:\n",

    "    - [NIST Standard Reference Databases](https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-standard-reference-database-35)\n",
    "- There are commercially available libraries, e.g., [Sigma-Aldrich Library of FT-IR Spectra](https://sciencesolutions.wiley.com/solutions/technique/ir/sigma-aldrich-library-of-ft-ir-spectra/)\n",
    "    - FT-IR Spectra: 11,270\n",
    "    - Distinct Sigma-Aldrich Catalog Numbers: 11,270\n",
    "    - > Take the guesswork out of your spectral analysis and create greater efficiencies in your lab. Our comprehensive libraries feature fully-reviewed, high-quality spectroscopy databases, enabling confident compound identification for a variety of environmental, forensic, pharmaceutical and industrial applications.\n",
    "- Another strategy is to generate spectral libraries for specific applications. This is especially useful when samples may contain proprietary molecules. Another benefit of generating new spectral libraries is that you can ensure that reference spectra were obtained using the same methodology as for samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scoring Matches\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workflow, the spectrum for the sample will be score against each spectrum in the library. One approach is to score matches based on their \"hit quality index\" (HQI, typical score range between zero and one), which can depend on mathematical properties such as the Euclidean distance, the mean absolute deviation, or the correlation coefficient. High scoring matches are reported to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many newer methods also contextualize this score by estimating a p-value. \n",
    "- A null distribution of HQI scores is created by comparing the spectrum for the target analyte with those spectra for random molecules that are not the target. These random comparisons establish what HQI scores would be expected by chance.\n",
    "- For an observed HQI score, the p-value is calculated as the proportion of null distribution scores that are greater than or equal to the observed score.\n",
    "- Critical HQI values can be determined for common significance levels (e.g., $\\alpha = 0.05$)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, four samples are qualitatively analyzed to determine whether the sample is microcrystalline cellulose. Consistent with all samples being different cellulose containing species, they all yield HQI that are close to the upper limit of one. However, only the true microcrystalline cellulose sample passes the probability test at the 95% confidence level ($p-value > 0.05$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table 2.** Sample data from Thermo-Scientific, testing the null hypothesis that the sample is microcrystalline cellulose (alternative hypothesis: the sample is not microcrystalline cellulose)\n",
    "| Sample | p-value | HQI |\n",

    "| Hydroxypropyl Cellulose | 0.0000000323 |0.9796 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we described library searching and p-value estimation for FT-IR spectra, but this approach is also used for many of experiments that generate spectra with many features for individual analytes (e.g., mass spectrometry).\n"

This design creates a long effective pathlength in a compact space, typically achieving 20-200 passes. Herriott cells are commonly used in trace gas analysist by increasing sensitivity by lengthening the interaction path between light and sample gas.

    "\n",
    "Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) is a laser-based absorption technique that measures the decay rate of light trapped in a high-finesse optical cavity formed by two highly reflective mirrors (typically R > 99.99%). A laser pulse is injected into the cavity, and the time-dependent decay of the trapped light (the \"ring-down\") is measured. When a sample in the cavity absorbs light, it accelerates the decay rate. By comparing decay rates with and without the sample, the absolute absorption can be determined independent of laser power fluctuations. \n",

    "\n",
    "Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) IR spectroscopy uses a high refractive index crystal (typically diamond, germanium, or zinc selenide) in contact with a sample. IR light enters the crystal at an angle greater than the critical angle, undergoes total internal reflection, and creates an evanescent wave that penetrates a few microns into the sample. The light is partially absorbed by the sample during each reflection, resulting in an IR spectrum. The technique requires minimal sample preparation, works well with aqueous solutions (due to short pathlength), and is especially useful for surface analysis, thick or strongly absorbing materials, and hard-to-prepare samples like polymers, pastes, powders, and liquids.\n",

    "- The first PC accounts for the largest variance, the second PC captures the second most variance while being orthogonal to the first, and so on. \n",
