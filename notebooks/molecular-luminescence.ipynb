    "\n",
    "**Fluorescence** and **phosphorescence** are **photoluminescence processes** where molecules absorb light energy and re-emit it at longer wavelengths.\n",
    "- There are processes in which molecules absorb and re-emit photons at the same wavelength (e.g., *resonance fluorescence*), but those processes are not common in analytical spectroscopy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key differences\n",
    "- *Electronic transitions*: Fluorescence involves singlet-to-singlet transitions. Phosphorescence involves intersystem crossing to a triplet state followed by triplet-to-singlet transitions.\n",

    "**Figure 1.** Electronic spin states of molecules. In (a) the ground electronic state is shown. In the lowest-energy, or ground state, the spins are paired and that state is referred to as a *singlet state*. In (b) and (c), excited electronic states are shown. If the spins remain paired in the excited state, the molecule is in an *excited singlet state* (b). If the spins become unpaired, the molecule is in an *excited triplet state*. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Quantum yield* is the ratio of photons emitted to photons absorbed by a luminescent system: Fluorescence typically has higher quantum yields since triplet state transitions are formally forbidden, making phosphorescence less efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Timing*: Fluorescence occurs rapidly (nanoseconds) and stops immediately when excitation ends. Phosphorescence continues for longer periods (milliseconds to seconds or even hours) after excitation stops.\n",
    "    - *Absorption* (femptoseconds) and *vibrational relaxation* (picoseconds) occur on much faster time scales. In chemical physics, a wide range of time scales are used to study different aspects of energy transfer in molecules. \n",

    "\n",
    "- *Energy source*: Chemiluminescence uses chemical reaction energy; photoluminescence requires light absorption\n",

    "## Luminescence Assays Can Offer Higher Performance than Absorbance Assays  \n",
    "\n",
    "Luminescence measurements offer two key advantages relative to absorbance-based measurements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Sensitivity*: Luminescence causes an increase in signal relative to a dark background, rather than a decrease in signal relative to bright background. Luminesce-based assays are often up to 1000 fold more sensitive than absorbance-based assays.\n",
    "- *Dynamic range*: Luminescence intensity is directly proportional to concentration, without the logarithmic relationship of absorbance. Luminesce-based assays often exhibit 4-6 orders of magnitude of linear dynamic range, whereas absorbance-based assays often exhibit only 2-3 orders of magnitude of linear dynamic range.\n",
    "    - *Linear dynamic range* is the concentration range over which instrument response is directly proportional to analyte concentration, typically expressed as orders of magnitude between the limit of quantitation and where the response deviates from linearity.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Luminescence measurements also benefit from greater *selectivity*, which we'll discus later."

    "### Selectivity as a Figure of Merit\n",
    "\n",
    "- In qualitative analysis, selectivity is the extent to which an assay reports the presence of an analyte for samples that do not contain the analyte (the false-positive rate). This is typical due the analytical method yielding signal for molecules in the sample that are not the analyte (an interferent).\n",
    "- In quantitative analysis, selectivity is the extent to which an assay reports signal for molecules in the sample that are not the analyte. The causes a positive error; the assay yields a higher apparent amount of the analyte than the true amount.\n",

    "### Selectivity in Photoluminecence\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that emission spectra in photoluminescence depends on the electronic properties of the analyte and the excitation wavelength. Monitoring photons at a specific emission wavelength from samples that were excited at a specific wavelength can increase selectivity because only interferents that absorb and emit at those wavelengths will contribute signal.\n",
