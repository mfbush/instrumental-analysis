## Question 1: Spectrofluorometry Instrumentation and Quantitative Analysis

Quinine exhibits strong fluorescence with excitation at 350 nm and emission at 450 nm. A pharmaceutical quality control laboratory uses spectrofluorometry to verify quinine content in antimalarial tablets. The following data were collected using quinine standards in dilute H₂SO₄:

| Solution | Fluorescence Intensity (arbitrary units) |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| Blank (dilute H₂SO₄) | 5.2 |
| 5.0 ppm quinine standard | 127.8 |
| 10.0 ppm quinine standard | 250.6 |
| 20.0 ppm quinine standard | 496.2 |
| Unknown tablet solution | 373.6 |

**Sample preparation:**
- One tablet was dissolved in 100.0 mL dilute H₂SO₄ (Solution A)
- 1.00 mL of Solution A was diluted to 100.0 mL with dilute H₂SO₄ (Solution B, analyzed above)
- Target quinine content: 150 mg per tablet (±10%)

**a)** Construct a calibration curve by calculating the slope and intercept. First subtract the blank, then use linear regression or calculate from two points. Show your work.

**b)** Using your calibration equation, calculate the concentration of quinine (in ppm) in Solution B (the diluted unknown).

**c)** Calculate the concentration of quinine in Solution A (in ppm), accounting for the dilution factor.

<br><br><br>

**d)** Convert the concentration in Solution A to mass of quinine in the original tablet (in mg).

**e)** Is this tablet within the acceptable range for quinine content? Show your reasoning.

**Yes**     **No**

<br><br>

**f)** Why is the 90° angle between excitation beam and emission detector critical in spectrofluorometry? (circle one)

- To minimize detection of scattered excitation light that would increase background signal
- To maximize the path length through the sample for better sensitivity
- To ensure equal excitation of all molecules in the sample
- To prevent photodecomposition of the fluorescent molecules

## Question 2: Luminescence Instrumentation and Techniques

**a)** Sketch a simplified block diagram for a basic spectrofluorometer. Your diagram must include and clearly label:
- Light source
- Excitation monochromator  
- Sample cell
- Emission monochromator
- Detector
- **Show the 90° geometry between excitation and emission paths**

**b)** Complete the following comparison table for luminescence techniques:

| Technique | Energy Source for Excitation | External Light Source Required? | Typical Application |
|-----------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Fluorescence | | | |
| Phosphorescence | | | |
| Chemiluminescence | | | |

<br><br><br><br>

**c)** For each luminescence technique, state one key advantage over the others:

- **Fluorescence:**

- **Phosphorescence:**

- **Chemiluminescence:**

<br><br><br>

**d)** Fluorescein is widely used as a fluorescent molecular probe in biological imaging. List three properties that make a molecule well-suited as a fluorescent probe:

1. 

2. 

3. 

<br><br>

**e)** Why is fluorescence spectroscopy typically 1000× more sensitive than absorption spectrophotometry for detecting suitable analytes? (circle one)

- Fluorescence uses shorter wavelengths than absorption
- Fluorescence detectors are inherently more sensitive than absorption detectors  
- Fluorescence measures signal against a near-zero background, while absorption measures a small difference between large signals
- Fluorescence requires two monochromators instead of one

## Question 3: Luminescence Fundamentals and Jablonski Diagrams

**a)** Draw a detailed Jablonski diagram showing the processes of absorption, fluorescence, and phosphorescence. Your diagram must include:
- Ground state ($S_0$) and excited singlet states ($S_1$, $S_2$)
- Triplet state ($T_1$)
- Vibrational energy levels within each electronic state (show at least 3 levels per electronic state)
- Label the following transitions with arrows: absorption, vibrational relaxation, internal conversion, fluorescence, intersystem crossing, phosphorescence

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

**b)** Based on your Jablonski diagram, explain why fluorescence emission typically occurs at longer wavelengths than the absorbed excitation light. Your answer should identify the specific energy-loss process and state transitions involved.

<br><br><br><br>

**c)** Compare fluorescence and phosphorescence by completing this table:

| Property | Fluorescence | Phosphorescence |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Electronic transition (specify states) | | |
| Spin multiplicity change? (yes/no) | | |
| Typical timescale | | |
| Allowed or forbidden transition? | | |

<br><br>

**d)** Aromatic compounds with extended conjugated π-systems (like anthracene) typically exhibit strong fluorescence, while aliphatic saturated hydrocarbons (like hexane) show no fluorescence. Explain this difference by addressing:
- The role of conjugation in determining HOMO-LUMO gap size
- How molecular rigidity vs. flexibility affects radiative vs. non-radiative decay rates

<br><br><br><br>

**e)** Which statement BEST describes fluorescence excitation spectra? (circle one)

- Fluorescence excitation spectra show which wavelengths are emitted when the sample is excited at a fixed wavelength
- Fluorescence excitation spectra closely resemble absorption spectra because both measure wavelengths that promote molecules to excited states
- Fluorescence excitation spectra are always red-shifted compared to absorption spectra  
- Fluorescence excitation spectra only measure triplet state formation
