# Suggested Problems: Components of Optical Instruments

## Question 1: Detector Response and Beer's Law Calculations

A portable photometer with a linear response to radiation is being used to determine the concentration of iron(III) in groundwater samples. The photometer measures current (in μA) that is directly proportional to the radiant power striking the detector.

**Given:**
- The instrument was first zeroed with no light striking the detector
- With pure water in the sample holder, the photometer registered 82.5 μA
- A standard solution containing 5.00 ppm Fe³⁺ (complexed with thiocyanate to form the red Fe(SCN)₂⁺ complex) gave a reading of 23.8 μA
- An unknown groundwater sample, after identical treatment with thiocyanate, gave a reading of 48.6 μA
- Measurements were made at 480 nm
- Path length = 1.00 cm

**Calculate:**

a) The percent transmittance of the standard solution

b) The absorbance of the standard solution

c) The concentration of Fe³⁺ in the unknown groundwater sample (in ppm)

d) What current reading would you expect for a sample containing 7.50 ppm Fe³⁺?

e) Based on the wavelength of maximum absorption (480 nm), what color would you expect to observe for the Fe(SCN)₂⁺ complex? Briefly explain your reasoning.

## Question 2: Light Sources and Instrument Components

a) Draw a block diagram showing the essential components (in the correct order) for a UV-Vis absorption spectrophotometer used for quantitative analysis. Label each component clearly.

b) Your laboratory stocks three different light sources for spectroscopic measurements:
   - Deuterium discharge lamp
   - Tungsten-halogen lamp  
   - Hollow cathode lamp (sodium)

For each analytical measurement below, identify the most appropriate light source from the list above and provide one brief justification (1-2 sentences):

   **i. Quantitative determination of aspirin by measuring absorbance at 276 nm**
   
   Light source: ___________________________
   
   Justification:

   **ii. Measuring the absorption spectrum of a blue dye from 400-700 nm**
   
   Light source: ___________________________
   
   Justification:

   **iii. Atomic absorption measurement of sodium at 589 nm**
   
   Light source: ___________________________
   
   Justification:

c) Explain why a deuterium lamp produces a continuum spectrum in the UV region rather than discrete emission lines like a hydrogen lamp.

d) What is the primary advantage of using a deuterium discharge lamp instead of a hydrogen discharge lamp for UV spectroscopy?

e) Why can a photomultiplier tube not be used to detect infrared radiation beyond approximately 1100 nm?

## Question 3: Monochromators and Wavelength Selection

A pharmaceutical laboratory is developing methods for drug analysis and needs to optimize their instrument settings.

a) The drug compound shows an absorbance maximum at 325 nm with a natural bandwidth (width at half-maximum absorbance) of approximately 12 nm. 

   **i. For quantitative analysis at 325 nm, would you recommend using a monochromator slit width of 1 nm or 10 nm? Circle one:**
   
   Narrow slit (1 nm)  /  Wide slit (10 nm)

   **ii. Briefly justify your choice, considering the trade-off between spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio:**

   **iii. For qualitative analysis (obtaining a detailed absorbance spectrum across 250-400 nm to identify the compound and detect any impurities), would you use the same slit width? Explain why or why not:**

b) Draw a simplified diagram of a grating monochromator showing the entrance slit, diffraction grating, and exit slit. Use arrows to indicate the light path and label each component.

c) In your diagram from part (b):
   - What is the function of the entrance slit (the slit before the dispersing element)?
   - What happens to the spectral resolution if the entrance slit is made wider?

d) Compare the use of interference filters versus monochromators for wavelength selection in absorption measurements:

   **i. Which provides better wavelength selectivity (narrower bandwidth)?**

   **ii. Give one specific advantage of using an interference filter instead of a monochromator:**

   **iii. Give one specific advantage of using a monochromator instead of an interference filter:**

e) The laboratory has both a single-beam spectrophotometer and a double-beam spectrophotometer available. For routine analysis of 50 samples per day at a single wavelength (280 nm), which instrument would be more practical and why? Consider factors such as stability, throughput, and operational convenience in your answer.

## Relevant Equations

$$\%T = \frac{P}{P_0} \times 100$$

$$A = -\log_{10}(T) = -\log_{10}\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)$$

$$A = \varepsilon b c$$

where $A$ = absorbance, $T$ = transmittance, $P$ = radiant power transmitted, $P_0$ = incident radiant power, $\varepsilon$ = molar absorptivity (M⁻¹ cm⁻¹), $b$ = path length (cm), $c$ = concentration (M)
